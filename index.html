    <h2>Welcome to Odin recipes!</h2>
    <p>Prepare to embark on a culinary journey that's as unpredictable as Gumball Watterson's misadventures. Also this must be the weirdest recipes website you'll ever encounter but don't worry you won't turn out like the Wattersons (in these pictures below). Get ready to chuckle, munch, spice up your kitchen escapades (and gain some fat) with us!</p>
    <p>P/S: We are currently having three recipes right now but we will definitely have more! (we guess)</p>
